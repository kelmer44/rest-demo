/**
 * Concrete implementation to load tasks from the data sources into a cache.
 * <p>
 * For simplicity, this implements a dumb synchronisation between locally persisted data and data
 * obtained from the server, by using the remote data source only if the local database doesn't
 * exist or is empty.
 * <p />
 * By marking the constructor with {@code @Inject} and the class with {@code @Singleton}, Dagger
 * injects the dependencies required to create an instance of the TasksRespository (if it fails, it
 * emits a compiler error). It uses {@link TasksRepositoryModule} to do so, and the constructed
 * instance is available in {@link TasksRepositoryComponent}.
 * <p />
 * Dagger generated code doesn't require public access to the constructor or class, and
 * therefore, to ensure the developer doesn't instantiate the class manually and bypasses Dagger,
 * it's good practice minimise the visibility of the class/constructor as much as possible.
